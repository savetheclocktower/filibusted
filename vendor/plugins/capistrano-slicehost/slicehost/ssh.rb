    Uploads your local public SSH keys to the server. A .ssh folder is created if \
    one does not already exist. The SSH keys default to the ones set in \
    Capistrano's ssh_options. You can change this by setting ssh_options[:keys] = \
    ["/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa"].

  desc <<-DESC
    Configure SSH daemon with more secure settings recommended by Slicehost. The \
    will be configured to run on the port configured in Capistrano's "ssh_options". \
    This defaults to the standard SSH port 22. You can change this by setting \
    ssh_options[:port] = 3000. Note that this change will not take affect until \
    reload the SSH service with `cap ssh:reload`.
