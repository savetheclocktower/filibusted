# Filibusted

When Senators filibuster, we think you ought to know about it. Filibusted points out legislative piracy as it happens.

## How it works

The arcane details of what goes on in the U.S. Senate are recorded on a daily basis by GovTrack, then put into a machine-readable format so it can be consumed by others.

Every night, Filibusted checks to see what the Senate voted on that day. If there were any cloture votes, it finds out all it can about them — any associated bills and amendments, who voted which way, and so on — and stores it.

Sunlight Labs, the geek-friendly project of the Sunlight Foundation, assisted with basic information and photos for each senator.
